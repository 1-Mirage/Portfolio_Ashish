        <h1>Principles</h1>
        <h3>SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLES</h3>
        <div>
            <strong>A class should have only one reason to change</strong>
            <div>
            Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by software and that responsibility should be entirely
            encapsulated by the class.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLES</h3>
        <div>
            <strong>No client should be forced to depend on method it does not use</strong>
            <div>
                One fat interface need to be split to many smalls and relevant interfaces so that clients can know about the interfaces
                that are relevant to them
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLES</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
            <li>Software entities such as classes,modules,functions etc. should be open for extension , but closed for modification.</li>
            <li>Any new functionality should be implemented by adding new classes,attributes and methods instead of changing the current ones or existing one.</li>

        </div>
        <h3>Liskov Substitution</h3>
        <div>
            <strong>If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that 
                program.</strong>

                This principle aims to enforce consistency so that the parent Class or its child Class can be used in the same way without any errors.    
        </div>
        <h3>Dependency Inversion</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

                </li>
            </ul>

            This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
